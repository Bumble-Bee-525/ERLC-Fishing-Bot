Place all these files into a single folder. Then double click the "FishingERLC.exe" file to run it. In the future, I'll upload a better exe into this repo.

# Instructions for using fishing bot:
- fish manually yourself until your inventory is full of fish all the way to slot 0
- open up OP autoclicker and set repeat until 1 times, not repeat until stopped, and set the activation key to [
- make sure your fishing rod is not equipped
- load or create a tinytask file, where the hotkey is ctrl alt shift p, where you:
    - equip the fishing rod
    - cast the rod somewhere consistent
- minimize the tinytask window and autoclicker window
- find the exe file in the folder open it, then minimize it
- manually cast the rod and when the fishing minigame starts:
    - RAPIDLY move the mouse to the upper left of the fishing bar and press p
    - RAPIDLY move the mouse to the bottom right of the fishing bar and press p
    - RAPIDLY move the mouse over the fish icon to the right of the fishing bar and press p
    - you don't have to get all 3 of these on the same cast, just make sure they are accurate
- Now, unequip the fishing rod
- Finally, when you are ready, press p and do not touch anything, the autofisher will begin
- if you want to exit, hold the X key until you are sure the program has quit
